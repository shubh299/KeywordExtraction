Documents contain some significant terms highlighting the invaluable information also supported by other words in the document and these significant terms are called Keywords. Words which we define as a sequence of one or more words, provide a compact representation of a document’s content and that can describe the meaning of the document are termed as Keywords. 
	Ideally, keywords represent, in condensed form, the essential content of a document. Keywords are widely used to define queries within information retrieval (IR) systems as they are easy to define, revise, remember, and share. Keywords have also been applied to improve the functionality of IR systems. In other words, relevant extracted keywords can be used to build an automatic index for a document collection or alternatively can be used for document representation in categorization or classification tasks. An extractive summary of the document is the core task of many IR and NLP applications. In comparison to mathematical signatures, keywords are independent of any corpus and can be applied across multiple corpora and IR systems.
	Keyword extraction (KE) is defined as the task that automatically identifies a set of the terms that best describe the subject of document. Keywords given by the author are very common in research articles and their purpose is to give the reader an idea of the article. Although, in general, the authors do not just collect the important phrases from their articles, they are either extracted from the original or with minor modifications. Extracting keywords is one of the most important tasks when working with text.
